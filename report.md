# Medium Issues

<a name="M-1"></a>
## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<a name="M-2"></a>
## M-2: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

# NC Issues

<a name="NC-1"></a>
## NC-1: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

## NC-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.
